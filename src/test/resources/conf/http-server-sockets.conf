# The SO_TIMEOUT value on client sockets. Reading from the socket will block for up to this long (in milliseconds) before the read
# fails. A value of 0 (the socket's default) causes the read to wait indefinitely (if no data arrives).

# If set, transmitted data is not collected together for greater efficiency but sent immediately.
org.mule.runtime.http.server.socket.sendTcpNoDelay=false

# The SO_LINGER value. This is related to how long (in milliseconds) the socket will take to close so that any
# remaining data is transmitted correctly.
org.mule.runtime.http.server.socket.linger=30000

# SO_KEEPALIVE behavior on open sockets. This automatically checks socket connections that are open but unused for long
# periods and closes them if the connection becomes unavailable.

# Enabling SO_REUSEADDR prior to binding the socket using bind(SocketAddress) allows the socket to be bound even though a
# previous connection is in a clientSocketTimeout state.

# The maximum queue length for incoming connections.
org.mule.runtime.http.server.socket.receiveBacklog=42

# The SO_TIMEOUT value when the socket is used as a server. Reading from the socket will block for up to this long (in
# milliseconds) before the read fails. A value of 0 causes the read to wait indefinitely (if no data arrives).
